# Effective-Targetting-of-Advertisments
## ðŸ”¸Problem Definition
In this project, we will work with the advertising data of a marketing agency to develop a Machine Learning Algorithm that predicts if a particular user will click on an advertisement or not.

The data consists of 10 variables: 'Daily Time Spent on Site', `'Age'`, `'Area Income'`, `' Daily Internet Usage '`, `'Ad Topic Line'`, `'City'`,`'Male'`, `'Country'`, `'Timestamp'` and `'Clicked on Ad'`. The main variable we are interested in is` 'Clicked on Ad'`. This variable can have two possible outcomes: 0 and 1 ,where 0 refers to the case where a user didn't click the advertisement, while 1 refers to the scenario where a user clicks the advertisement.

We will see if we can use the other 9 variables to accurately predict the value 'Clicked on Ad' variable. We will also perform some exploratory data analysis to see how 'Daily Time Spent on Site' in combination with 'Ad Topic Line' affects the user's decision to click on the add.

## ðŸ‘‰ Application

Predicting  the probability of user  on clicking the ad which is shown to them on the websites
for the next 10-14  days based on historical view log data, ad impression data and user data. Since
every individual may have a different view of your brand, stories can resonate with
everyone differently. Through target marketing using Machine Learning , you can better understand each customer's needs and create a marketing campaign that targets a specific audience, so you can meet their expectations and also to help the Advertisment and Brand company will be able  to konw their audience choices.

## âœ“ Conclusion

In this project we have trained our dataset and designed a model using different algorithms and analyzed that which Machine Learning Model will best fit this Dataset(for more  detail : refer the notebook) .After the training and testing it our model is ready to predict wheather the user will click on  the Advertisment or not with the features present in the dataset.
